# Kotlin
Kotlin is a modern programming language that is concise, safe, pragmatic, and focused on interoperability with Java code. It can be used almost everywhere Java is used today: for server-side development, Android apps, and much more.Recently Google announced that Android development will be increasingly Kotlin-first and that many top apps have already migrated to Kotlin.
