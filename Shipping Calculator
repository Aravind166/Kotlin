QUESTION HERE IS :

You are working on a eCommerce website and need to make a shipping cost calculator based on the order amount.
The store uses the following cost structure:
For orders in the US:
- $75+ orders have free shipping
- orders less than $75 have a shipping fee of 10% of the total order amount.

For international orders, there is a 15% shipping fee, with a maximum of $50. This means that the maximum shipping fee for an international order is $50.

You need to complete the given shippingCost() function, which takes the order amount and a Boolean indicating whether the order is international or not, and returns the shipping cost for that order.
The return amount should be a Double.

Sample Input:
140.0
true

Sample Output:
21.0

HINT : The order is for $140 and is international. So, the shipping cost would be 15%, which is $21.

SOLUTION :

fun shippingCost(amount: Double, international: Boolean): Double {
    var cost = 0.0
    
    if (international) {
        cost = if (amount * 0.15 > 50) 50.0 else amount * 0.15
    }
    else if (amount < 75) {
        cost = amount * 0.1
    }    
    return cost
}

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    val total = readLine()!!.toDouble()
    val international = readLine()!!.toBoolean()    
    println(shippingCost(total, international))
}
